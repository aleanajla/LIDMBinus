            "desc" : "MIT professor Sinan Aral isn't only one of the world's leading experts on social media--he's also an entrepreneur and investor, giving him an unparalleled 360-degree view of the technology's great promise as well as its outsize capacity to damage our politics, our economy, and even our personal health.\n\nDrawing on two decades of his own research and business experience, Aral goes under the hood of the biggest, most powerful social networks to tackle the critical question of just how much social media actually shapes our choices, for better or worse. Aral shows how the tech behind social media offers the same set of behavior-influencing levers to both Russian hackers and brand marketers--to everyone who hopes to change the way we think and act--which is why its consequences affect everything from elections to business, dating to health. Along the way, he covers a wide array of topics, including how network effects fuel Twitter's and Facebook's massive growth to the neuroscience of how social media affects our brains, the real consequences of fake news, the power of social ratings, and the impact of social media on our kids.\n\nIn mapping out strategies for being more thoughtful consumers of social media, The Hype Machine offers the definitive guide to understanding and harnessing for good the technology that has redefined our world overnight.

            "desc" : "Isaac Asimov quickened dozens of short stories and half a dozen novels with Laws of Robotics that restricted his fictional machines while leaving enough loopholes for propulsive plots. Frank Pasquale’s New Laws of Robotics takes aim at the more mundane artificial intelligence technology of today and our immediate tomorrow, but with more ambition. He plots a future where technologies like factory robots, medical diagnosis algorithms, and online learning make society more just. \n\nRather than just binding machines, Pasquale’s new laws aim to limit the humans who build and deploy them. He lays out four: that AI systems never pose as people; do not feed arms races for military or social control; augment professionals but don’t replace them; and always indicate the people who built, own, and control them.\nThis form of robot law enforcement is about much more than computer code—Pasquale calls for a society-wide reengineering of policy, politics, economics, and labor relations to set technology on a more regulated and egalitarian path. He wants to reprogram the future of tech like classroom robots and online platforms with labor unions and regulatory agencies. That future can be harder to imagine than the overfamiliar outlines of standard tech utopias, which don’t much concern themselves with administrative law. But Pasquale makes a good case for injecting more bureaucracy into our techno-dreams, if we really want to make the world a better place. —Tom Simonite ",

            "desc" : "In Voices from the Valley, the celebrated writers and Logic cofounders Moira Weigel and Ben Tarnoff take an unprecedented dive into the tech industry, conducting unfiltered, in-depth, anonymous interviews with tech workers at all levels, including a data scientist, a start-up founder, a cook who serves their lunch, and a PR wizard. In the process, Weigel and Tarnoff open the conversation about the tech industry at large, a conversation that has previously been dominated by the voices of CEOs. Deeply illuminating, revealing, and at times lurid, Voices from the Valley is a vital and comprehensive view of an industry that governs our lives.\n\nFSG Originals × Logic dissects the way technology functions in everyday lives. The titans of Silicon Valley, for all their utopian imaginings, never really had our best interests at heart: recent threats to democracy, truth, privacy, and safety, as a result of tech’s reckless pursuit of progress, have shown as much. We present an alternate story, one that delights in capturing technology in all its contradictions and innovation, across borders and socioeconomic divisions, from history through the future, beyond platitudes and PR hype, and past doom and gloom. Our collaboration features four brief but provocative forays into the tech industry’s many worlds, and aspires to incite fresh conversations about technology focused on nuanced and accessible explorations of the emerging tools that reorganize and redefine life today.",

            "desc" : "Brian Jefferson explores the history of digital computing and criminal justice, revealing how big tech, computer scientists, university researchers, and state actors have digitized carceral governance over the past forty years. He shows how digital technology has expanded the wars on crime and drugs, enabling our current state of mass incarceration and further entrenching the nation’s racialized policing and punishment.\n\nDigitize and Punish is pathbreaking. It is an example of what interdisciplinary training and spatial thinking should be. Brian Jefferson’s powerful analysis is laid out with surgical detail, illuminating the profound crisis ‘digital prisons’ have for all of us. It also accomplishes a rare scholarly feat: it’s written with crisp and, at times, witty prose. Read. This. Book.\n—Rashad Shabazz, author of Spatializing Blackness: Architectures of Confinement and Black Masculinity in Chicago",
